# Homework

## CM-HW1
Build an app that acts as a dialler, with a “keypad” to enter the numberto call. Start with the simplest approach possible. 

When you press the dial button, a call should be started (just hand-over to the “real” built-in dialler, using an implicit Intent).

You should add a set of 3 “speed dial” buttons.When the user does a long press on one of these “speed dials”, a secondary activity(or fragment)is offered to allow the user to update the speed dial details (the label and associated number).

Note: you don’t need to save the definition of the speed dials, but if you choose to, consider using SharedPreferences.
