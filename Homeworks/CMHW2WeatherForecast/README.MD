## CM-HW2
Build an app that offers a weather forecast. 
The user should, first, select a city from a list of cities, and then get the forecast for the upcoming days. 

The app should make use of fragments (and RecyclerView) and offer two layout arrangements.

The weather forecast content should be obtained by invoking an external API (a sample code snippet will be available to use with IPMA).
